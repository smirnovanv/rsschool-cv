### **About myself**

My career as a front-end development started as a mere interest in how websites and apps are designed but it grew quickly into a deep passion for front-end development. I was lucky to come across awesome courses by _HtmlAcademy_, met people who are fascinated by mastering their skills and sharing their experience. Later on, I got a job as a front-end developer in _Akvelon_, one of the largest IT-companies in my city. I got an experience in front-end (**React**) and back-end (**Nest**) development working on internal projects of the company. Finally, I was transferred to the _Microsoft PowerBI Visuals_ project. As I wanted to get more experience with **React**, I got a position of front-end developer in _CNET_ and _Liga of Digital Technologies_.

I'm planning to keep mastering my skills as front-end developer and work with **React** or **Vue/Angular**, as it's what I'm interested in now.
