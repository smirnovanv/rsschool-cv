          <h3>About myself</h3>
          <p>
            My career as a front-end development started as a mere interest in
            how websites and apps are designed but it grew quickly into a deep
            passion for front-end development. I was lucky to come across
            awesome courses by HtmlAcademy, met people who are fascinated by
            mastering their skills and sharing their experience. Later on, I got
            a job as a front-end developer in Akvelon, one of the largest
            IT-companies in my city. I got an experience in front-end React and
            back-end Nest development working on internal projects of the
            company. Finally, I was transferred to the Microsoft PowerBI Visuals
            project. As I wanted to get more experience with React, I got a
            position of front-end developer in CNET and Liga of Digital
            Technologies. I'm planning to keep mastering my skills as front-end
            developer and work with React or Vue/Angular, as it's what I'm
            interested in now.
